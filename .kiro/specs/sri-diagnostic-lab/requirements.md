# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SRI DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY & HEALTH CARE is a full-stack diagnostic laboratory and healthcare platform built with FastAPI (backend), Angular (frontend), and PostgreSQL (database), deployed via Docker Compose. The platform enables patients to book lab tests online or schedule home sample collection, track their sample status, download reports, and manage family health records. Lab technicians can manage assigned bookings and upload reports. Admins have full control over tests, packages, pricing, service areas, technicians, and analytics.

3. THE System SHALL log the outcome (success or failure) of each backup operation with a timestamp and the size of the backup file in bytes.
4. IF a scheduled backup fails, THEN THE System SHALL emit an ERROR level log entry and SHALL send an alert Notification to the configured Admin email address.
5. THE System SHALL include a documented recovery procedure (in the project README) describing the steps to restore the database from a backup file, with an expected recovery time objective of 4 hours.

### Requirement 26: Frontend UX States

**User Story:** As a User, I want the frontend to clearly communicate loading, empty, and error states, so that I always understand what is happening and what actions are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE an API request is in progress, THE System SHALL display a loading indicator on the relevant UI component and SHALL disable interactive controls that would trigger duplicate requests.
2. WHEN an API response returns an empty result set, THE System SHALL display a contextual empty-state message (e.g., "No bookings found") rather than a blank area.
3. WHEN an API response returns an error, THE System SHALL display a human-readable error message derived from the API error response `message` field and SHALL provide a retry action where applicable.
4. WHILE a User's pincode is not covered by an active Service_Area, THE System SHALL disable the home collection booking option and display a "Not available in your area" message with a "Notify Me" call-to-action.
5. WHEN a Time_Slot has no remaining capacity, THE System SHALL display it as unavailable in the slot selection UI and SHALL NOT allow the User to select it.
6. IF a session token expires during an active session, THEN THE System SHALL redirect the User to the login page and display a "Session expired, please log in again" message.

### Requirement 27: Data Retention Policy

**User Story:** As a system owner, I want a documented and enforced data retention policy, so that the platform complies with healthcare data regulations and manages storage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL retain all Report files and associated Booking records for a minimum of 7 years from the date of the Booking to satisfy healthcare compliance requirements.
2. WHEN a Booking or Payment record exceeds 3 years of age, THE System SHALL automatically archive it to a separate archive table or cold storage destination and remove it from the primary operational tables.
3. THE System SHALL log each archival operation with the entity type, entity ID, archival timestamp, and destination.
4. IF an archival operation fails for any record, THEN THE System SHALL log the failure with the entity type, entity ID, and error details, and SHALL retry the operation in the next scheduled archival run.
5. THE System SHALL implement a documented data deletion policy: WHEN a User submits an account deletion request, THE System SHALL anonymise all personally identifiable fields on the User record and associated Family_Member records within 30 days, while retaining anonymised Booking and Payment records for the required retention period.
6. THE System SHALL prevent deletion of any Report or Booking record that is within its mandatory 7-year retention window through application-level and database-level constraints.

### Requirement 28: Feature Flags

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to enable or disable named features at runtime, so that I can roll out or roll back functionality without requiring a new deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide an Admin-accessible API to create, read, update, and delete Feature_Flag records, each identified by a unique string key (e.g., `home_collection`, `online_payment`, `notify_me`).
2. THE System SHALL store Feature_Flag state (enabled/disabled) in the database as the source of truth.
3. THE System SHALL cache Feature_Flag state in an in-process or shared cache with a maximum TTL of 60 seconds, so that flag changes propagate to all running instances within 60 seconds without requiring a restart.
4. WHEN a feature is controlled by a Feature_Flag and the flag is disabled, THE System SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response with `error_code` set to `FEATURE_DISABLED` for any request that attempts to use that feature.
5. WHEN an Admin updates a Feature_Flag, THE System SHALL create an Audit_Log entry recording the flag key, previous state, new state, and the Admin's identity.
6. THE System SHALL seed the database with default Feature_Flag records for `home_collection`, `online_payment`, and `notify_me` on first startup if those records do not already exist.
